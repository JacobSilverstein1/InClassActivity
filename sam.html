      <h3> Danny Dimes beat the Saints!</h3>
      <p> 
      The Giants came back against the Saints and won in overtime thanks to the heroic efforts of Daniel Jones. He was drafted 6th overall in 2019 by the New York Giants out of Duke university.

      <h3>Kadarius Toney is very good</h3>
      <p>
      Kadarius Toney was the 20th pick in this year's draft by the New York Giants. He had a rough start, but last game broke the Giants rookie record for receiving yards in a game.
