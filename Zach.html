    <h3> A Buckeye</h3>
    <p> Zeke is terrible because he went to THE Ohio State University. An all around inferior school to Michigan, players from OSU 
      really just suck. He is prud of that fact, but he is in fact proud of a deficiency.
    </p>
    <h3> Tony Pollard is Better </h3>
    <p> The cowboys, in fact, have a superior runningback, but playing Zeke so much takes playing time away from Tony Pollard.
      The Cowboys spend a ton of money on both of these backfield players, yet they get the mninnimum possible value out of the players they have.
      This signifies bad team management and coaching, another reason why they will never win another playoff game.

      <h3> Zek Eats too much </h3>
    <p> As seen in the photo above, zeke is fat. For a player in such a competetive sport, for someone who is supposed to be an elite athlete, he should not be this fat.
